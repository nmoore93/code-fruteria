# 🍌 Code Fruteria 🍎

Welcome to the juiciest repo on GitHub! This is your backstage pass to a mock login system and the world’s first* digital fruit trading floor. (*Probably.)

> **Note:** This project runs best on **Node.js v22.17.0**.
> If you’re using a different version, you might end up with banana peels in your stack trace. If using a tool such as NVM, an nvmrc file is provided

## 🥝 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   _(Don’t worry, no actual fruit required.)_

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**
   _(Let the fruit fiesta begin!)_
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## 🍊 Mock Login

- Check out `auth/mockLogin.ts` for a taste of our authentication magic.
- Exports a `mockLogin` function that pretends to check your credentials.
- Try logging in as:
  - **admin** / **1234**
  - **user** / **password**
- _Yes, our security is softer than an overripe peach. Maybe engineers should take security a bit more seriously?_
- **Bonus:** If you want to show off your fullstack skills, build a real backend for authentication (Node.js or your favorite language) and earn extra fruit salad points!
- _P.S.: Feel free to use AI tools like **Amazon Q**, **GitHub Copilot**, or your favorite code assistant to help you out!_

# 🍇 Code Fruit Challenge

This repo is a stripped-down, vitamin-packed version of the code-fruit project. It’s got just enough pulp to get you started.

🎉 **Calling all code wizards and fruit fanatics!** 🍌🍎

Ever dreamed of trading apples for bananas like a Wall Street pro? Now’s your chance!
This app lets you swap strawberries for pineapples and pretend you’re the Gordon Gekko of the produce aisle. 🍍📊

But, like a forgotten banana, things have gotten a little… mushy:

- The codebase is a bit overripe and needs a refactor.
- We’re stuck on React 16—let’s peel up to React 18 (and maybe even React 19 if you’re feeling wild).
- The light theme could be fresher than a lemon on a summer day.
- There’s more juicy work to do, but let’s not bite off more than we can chew.
- _Some files are just lying around unused—let’s clean up the codebase and compost the leftovers!_
- **Bonus:** Migrate the build system from **Webpack** to **Vite** for a faster, fresher development experience!

Who’s ready to modernize this digital fruit bazaar? 🍇💻

## 🍉 Acceptance Criteria

- Upgrade the project to **React 18**.
  - Upgrading to **React 19** is a bonus, but React 18 is your first pit stop.
- Add **unit tests** before you start refactoring. (No squishy bugs allowed!)
- Upgrade all dependencies so they play nicely with React 18 (or 19, if you’re feeling zesty).
- Update both the **light** and **dark** themes—make them so fresh you’ll need sunglasses.
- **Fix the drag and drop for panels**—right now, it’s more slippery than a watermelon seed.
- **Tame the panel resizing**—currently, it’s wilder than a runaway grape.
- **Upgrade the grid/layout** so panels can go horizontal, vertical, or do the cha-cha for better visual combos.
- **Fix the theme switch** (light/dark)—right now, it’s more confused than a kiwi in a fruit salad.

## 🥭 Bonus

- **Migrate from Webpack to Vite:**
  Swap out the old Webpack setup for [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to enjoy lightning-fast hot module reloading and a simpler config.
  _Tip: Vite works great with React 18+ and will make your dev workflow as snappy as a fresh snap pea!_
- **Upgrade to React 19:**
  Take it to the next level by upgrading the project to [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-v19.0.0), and try out the latest features!
- **Implement a real backend for authentication:**
  Replace the mock frontend authentication with a real backend (Node.js or your favorite language).
  - Create an authentication server (REST or GraphQL) to handle login and user info.
  - Update the frontend to retrieve authentication and user data from the backend instead of mocking it.
- **Extra Credit:**
  - Document any migration steps or gotchas you encounter.
  - Compare build/start times before and after the migration.
  - Share your favorite Vite plugin for React projects!
